*cpp-syntax-extra.txt*	For Vim version 7.4.	Last change: 2015 Mar 9

Enhancements for C++ syntax highlighting.

The identifier NULL is highlighted as an Error (C++11 provides nullptr, which
is superior to NULL).

The keywords class and struct are highlighted according the Statement group.

Doxygen "todo" tags are highlighted according to the Todo highlight group.
These tags take the form of @todo or \\todo.

stl.vim is loaded, unless it is turned off by defining cpp_no_stl. This file
provides syntax highlighting for the Standard Template Library.

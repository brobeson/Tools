                    Cpp Folding Reference Manual

                       by Brendan Robeson

This plugin provides custom code folding text for C++ source code. It also
sets up the code folding options to use the fold text.

Code Folding Options                            *cpp_folding_options*
This plugin will set the following options for a C++ buffer: 'foldenable',
'foldmethod'=syntax, and 'foldtext'=CppFoldText(). The first turns on code
folding. The second tells Vim to determine folds based on syntax. The last
tells Vim to use this plugin's fold text function.

=============================================================================
Code Folding Text                               *cpp_folding*

The code folding text varies depending on what is folded.

Actual code, between braces, folds up to the following:
{     N lines }~

A C style comment block folds to:
/* The first line of the comment ... */~

If the cpp_doxygen plugin is loaded, a Javadoc or Qt style Doxygen comment
will display the brief text. See |cpp_doxygen-folding| for details.

Code surrounded by #if 0 ... #endif, folds to:
[ commented code ]~

All the fold text options indent the fold text to match the original
indentation of the first line of the fold.

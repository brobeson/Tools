                    Cpp New Class Reference Manual

                       by Brendan Robeson

This is a plugin for C++ code which stubs in a new class.

Insert a New Class                              *cpp_new_class*
Skeleton code for a new class can be inserted by typing <Leader>p. Vim will
prompt you for a class name, using the current file name, without the
extension, as the default. After inserting the code, the function will
autoindent it. The skeleton code takes the form:

class YourClassName final~
{~
    public:~
        YourClassName() = delete;~
        YourClassName(const YourClassName&) = default;~
        YourClassName& operator=(const YourClassName&) = default;~
        YourClassName(YourClassName&&) = default;~
        YourClassName& operator=(YourClassName&&) = default;~
        ~YourClassName() = default;~
    private:~
};~

Note a few things from that code:
1. C++11 is assumed by 'final' and '= default'.
2. The class is marked final. If the new class is intended to be a base class,
   just delete the final identifier.
3. The class is CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable, MoveConstructible, and
   MoveAssignable. This is intended to facilitate use in STL containers.

                    Cpp Tools Reference Manual

This is a plugin with some helpful commands for editing C++ code. This plugin
relies on |codeTools|, which adds more functionality than is listed here.
Codetools can be found at http://github.com/brobeson/Tools.

Comment/Uncomment Lines                         *cpp_tools_comment*
                                                *cpp_tools_uncomment*

A range of lines can be commented with C++ style comment text: //. If no
count is given, 1 (one) is used. To comment the lines, use the normal map:
[count]<Leader>c. Blank lines are not commented.

Similarly, a range of lines can be uncommented by typing [count]<Leader>u.
This is the inverse of the comment function, so it will not uncomment C style
comments (/* ... */). Note that this function just removes the first '//'
that it encounters on each line. It's possible, if the count is incorrect, to
uncomment a legitimate comment at the end of a line:
    class Foo;    // this is a foo class~
Using <Leader>u on the above line will produce this result:
    class Foo;   this is a foo class~

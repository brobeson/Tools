*html.txt*	    For Vim version 7.4.    Last Change: 2015 Mar 11

This is a new syntax file for HTML. This meant to replace the default
html.vim, not add to it. As such, I recommend you drop it in syntax/ instead
of after/syntax/.

Setting			Possible Values		Default~
*html_version*		    4|5			    5
    This variable controls highlighting of keywords introduced or deprecated
    by HTML 5. This also controls the value of |b:current_syntax|. 
*html_use_w3_style*	undefined|defined	undefined
    This variable controls whether deviated from W3C's style recommendations
    are highlighted. For example, if |html_use_w3_style| is set, tag and
    attribute names are forced to be lowercase.

After loading this |b:current_syntax| is set to 'html4' or 'html5', depending
on the value of |html_version|.

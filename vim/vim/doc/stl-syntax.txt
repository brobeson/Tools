Syntax highlighting for the C++ Standard Template Library.

This syntax file provides highlighting for functions, constants, classes,
etc. from the C++ Standard Template Library. Highlighting, generally, requires
the fully qualified name. This is by design.
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";  // std and cout are highlit
    using namespace std;	    // std is not highlit
    cout << "Hello World!\n";	    // cout is not highlit

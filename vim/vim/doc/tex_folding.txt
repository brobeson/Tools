*tex_tools.txt*     For Vim version 7.4.    Last Change: 2015 Mar 11

Plugin with some helpful commands for editing LaTeX code.

This plugin loads |codeTools|, which adds more functionality than is listed
here.

This plugin adds the following functionality:
2. Code Folding Text                |tex_tools-code-folding|
3. Comment/Uncomment Lines          |tex_tools-comment|
                        |tex_tools-uncomment|

=================================================================================
2. Code Folding Text                *tex_tools-code-folding*

The code folding text varies depending on what is folded.

If the first line is a comment, the comment text is used, appended with an
ellipsis. For example, if this line begins a fold in a LaTeX document:
    % description of this section {{{~
When folded, the fold text is simpley:
    description of this section ...~

If the first line is not a comment, the plugin looks for the first LaTeX
command (\begin, \section, etc) and uses that:
    \begin{document} %{{{~
folds up to
    \begin{document}...~
In this case, if a command is not found, the fold text is
    no LaTeX command found~

All the fold text options indent the fold text to match the original
indentation of the first line of the fold. The leading white space in the
examples above are simply to offset the examples from the normal help text.

=================================================================================
3. Comment/Uncomment Lines          *tex_tools-comment*
                        *tex_tools-uncomment*

A range of lines can be commented with %. If no count is given, 1 (one) is
used. To comment the lines, use the normal map [count]<Leader>c. Blank lines are
not commented.

Similarly, a range of lines can be uncommented by typing [count]<Leader>u.
Note that this function just removes the first '%' that it encounters on each
line. It's possible, if the count is incorrect, to uncomment a legitimate
comment at the end of a line:
    \section    % this is a comment~
Using <Leader>u on the above line will produce this result:
    \section     this is a comment~

Note that these commands do not work as expected with folded code. With the
cursor on this fold:
    \begin{document}...~
and pressing <Leader>c, will result in
    %\begin{document} %{{{~
    % the rest of the LaTeX, unfolded~
To comment the entire fold, use n<Leader>c, where n is the number of lines
folded; you don't need to open the fold before-hand.

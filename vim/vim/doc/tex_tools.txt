*tex_tools.txt*     For Vim version 7.4.    Last Change: 2015 Mar 11

Plugin with some helpful commands for editing LaTeX code.

This plugin loads |codeTools|, which adds more functionality than is listed
here.

Comment/Uncomment Lines             *tex_tools-comment*
                                    *tex_tools-uncomment*
A range of lines can be commented with %. If no count is given, 1 (one) is
used. To comment the lines, use the normal map [count]<Leader>c. Blank lines
are not commented.

Similarly, a range of lines can be uncommented by typing [count]<Leader>u.
Note that this function just removes the first '%' that it encounters on each
line. It's possible, if the count is incorrect, to uncomment a legitimate
comment at the end of a line:
    \section    % this is a comment~
Using <Leader>u on the above line will produce this result:
    \section     this is a comment~

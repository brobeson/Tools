*vs2013dark.txt*	For Vim version 7.4.	Last change: 2015 Mar 9

Color file imitating the Dark theme in MS Visual Studio 2013.

This is not an exact match. Some of VS's highlighting isn't possible in Vim,
since Vim does not have a compiler parser. For example, Vim cannot determine
that a particular character string is a local variable, and highlight it as
such. Other colors from VS can, in my opinion, be improved. For example, in
VS, the line numbers are bright blue. In Vim, I've made them dark gray so
they are less intrusive.

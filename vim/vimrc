" TODO	verify that on linux, the system and custom vimrc files are run

" i use these settings on my linux box at home, and my windows box at work.
" the home directory at work is mapped to a network share, so when i use the
" work laptop at home, i lose all the settings. hence, i need to reconfigure
" the rtp to get my settings (and plugins, etc) from my local profile.
"
" also, the windows version doesn't run both the system vimrc and my vimrc,
" hence i need to explicitly run it here.
